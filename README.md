# Cabbage Crashers

You're just a regular everyday cabbage farmer, trying to make your way in the world. But no matter how hard you try, the world is against you. In Cabbage Crashers, your goal is to survive for as many days before inevitably going bankrupt or succumbing to the pressures of the world and selling out to big cabbage.

## Cabbage Crashers is a cabbage farming simulation with these awesome features!
- **Cabbage Genetics**: Select two fully grown cabbages and splice them together to create a new cabbage seed to plant.
- **Advanced Market Simulation**: A dynamically updated market inspired by real commodities markets. The market changes based on in-game events and prices cabbages based on their attributes.
- **Events**: Random events help tell the story of your cabbage growing epic on your way to inevitable sellout to big cabbage. Read about events that impact the market in *The Daily Cabbage* newspaper and stay on the lookout for events affecting your upkeep costs!
- **Upgrades**: Upgrade the amount of plots for growing cabbages, save up for the special golden plot, buy the ultra powerful ferilizer, or get more splices per day!

NOTE: For the Windows build, close the game by pressing ALT-F4 (sorry!).

### **v1.1 (April 7, 2022)** 
Thanks for everyone’s feedback! We made some changes to make the game overall a better experience. We hope you enjoy and be sure to let us know of any further feedback.

**Quality of Life Changes**
- Improved hitboxes for cabbage plots
- Made clearer things like how to sell a cabbage, the “sellout” option, and upkeep.
- Lowered event sound volume
- The upkeep event should stay on the screen for longer and fade out gracefully. Also will disappear upon going to the next day.
- Some UI elements clarified and improved.
- New seeds go to the end of the inventory instead of the leftmost slot.


**Balance Changes**
- Negative events will happen more frequently.
- Market events should have an impact on prices slightly faster.
- Lowered initial max splices to 1.
- Increased price of a splice to $100.
- Increased price of the random seed.
- Tuned min and max values for cabbage attributes
- Cabbages that are not fully grown are worth less.
- Splicing is more likely to lead to cabbages that are better than the average of their parts


**Bug fixes**
- Fixed cabbage prices occasionally going to $0 with no event occurring. 
- The MIT blue cabbage event should properly impact blue cabbages.
- The red cabbage event should also impact cabbages red in color alongside “real” red cabbages.
